1. when microcontroller is reset using reset button or power, processor reads value at address 0x00000000 and set MSP to value stored at 0x00000000.
2. So, MSP = value(@0x00000000)
3. it then reads address 0x00000004, that is the address of reset_handler.
4. Stores the value at 0x00000004, to PC, which is the address of reset_handler. 
5. Reset_handler is the first function called by the processor on reset, and it does some basic initializatoins, before calling main().

Question: what does MSP do with the value set at reset?

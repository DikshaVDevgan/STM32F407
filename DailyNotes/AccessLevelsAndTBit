2 types of access levels:
Unprivilged Mode
Priviliged Mode

2 types of modes:
Thread Mode
User Mode


By default when code is executed, it run in Thread mode and in priviliged mode.
One can switch to Priviliged mode, by changing the CONTROL register using assembly instruction (as it is not a memory mapped regiter).
But cannot modify CONTROL register in unprivliged mode, so cannot come back to priviliged mode.
So, to do that an interrupt has to generate, so processor is in priviliged mode (interrupts always executed in priliviged mode) like SVC. When handling that interrupt, 
CONTROL register value can be changed to priviliged mode again.
Execptions/interruts will always be handled in priviliged mode. 



T bit EPSR:
ARM Cortex M only support Thumb instrutions or mix of Thumb and ARM instructions. that is 16-bit instruction set, which is ideal for memory constarined systems.
T bit in EPSR means that Thumb instruction is there in PC. In Cortex M, if T bit in EPSR is not 1, hard fault will be there.
